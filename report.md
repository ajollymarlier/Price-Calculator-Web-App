# **Web Technology Considerations**

Going into this project, I was not that familiar with the creation and deployment of web apps as a whole, and therefore a lot of research was done to make sure that I was choosing the best technologies for my current skill level.

## **Frontend Technology**
The three main technologies I considered for my frontend, were Angular, React, and Vue, since I wanted the app to be as responsive as possible.

My first point of consideration, was each technologies' popularity in the industry. According to StackOverflow's 2019 survey, *https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology*, React(31.3%) and Angular(30.7%) were much more more popular among web frameworks than Vue(15.2%). Since I wanted to choose a technology that was indicitave of what was popular among current developers, React or Angular seemed like the best choice.

Since this was my first time working with any kind of frontend frameworks, I wanted something with lots of documentation, and not too much customizability, since that would lead to inconsistent tutorials being produced. Since Vue's main drawing point was its customizability, that meant that the documentation I found was either way too vast for me to grasp in my limited working time, or two hyper-specified to one custom way of use. This meant that, again, React and Angular seemed more appealing, since they used a consistent Component-based system.

Since all three of these technologies excel as visual web frameworks, this aspect did not affect my decision at all.

Out of the three frameworks, I had only ever had experience React through a bootcamp I attended this past summer. Through that bootcamp, I created a small display board app with a filter function. I also used the framework, Material-UI to create professional looking components. This knowledge would serve me well with what I wanted to build for this assignment, therefore React seemed like the obvious choice for experience reasons.

Finally, we will look at the performance of all three frameworks. According to *https://blog.logrocket.com/angular-vs-react-vs-vue-a-performance-comparison/*, Vue leads the startup metrics, with React close behind, and Angular falling very short. This is because of Angular's heavy structure, and since I would only be using the frameworks for a small project, a lot of the structure will go unused. The same can also be seen for memory allocation, although React is a lot closer to Vue in this metric.

With all these factors taken into account, I decided to choose React since it was close to Vue in almost every performance and popularity metric, it boasted a clearer documentation style, and I had previous experience using it, so my learning time would be greatly decreased.
